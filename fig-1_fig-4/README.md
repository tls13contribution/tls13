# How To Make Figure 4

## 1. Extract the TLS 1.3 connections from daily crawled data

## 2. Run the platform identification script with the following options
### The script will generate two output files. One is a file that contains all the domains with their classification results (first party/third party). The other is a file that contains the daily ratio of the first party to the third party domains.
- You can specify the output file name with the option --output and --ratio.
- The output file is the result of the algorithm detailed in Figure 1 and the ratio file is used to draw Figure 4.
